#
# GitHub actions for building the distribution and wheels of the sgp4 package
# linting and testing the source.
#
# Contributed by @mworion
#
# Strategy:
# The action is called with each commit, pull request master (and) release
# branch. If commit is to release branch, the PyPI upload will follow
# successful tests automatically.
#
# Run lint on python source, build step by step the python distro and
# run all package tests for all OS and python versions
#
# If this job succeeds, build step by step all wheels for all OS and python
# versions and run the tests in accelerated mode.
#
# If the first two jobs succeed, upload the distro and wheels to PyPI
#

on:
  # the trigger event for running the action is either a push on master or
  # release branch

      - master
      - release

  # or a pull request to master branch

jobs:
  # This action is split into three jobs:
  # - Building the distribution linting and testing without acceleration
  # - Building the wheels for the distribution and testing with acceleration
  # - Uploading the artifacts to PyPI package if branch is release
  # The uploading job needs all tests to be finished without error.

  build_test_dist:
    # Build the distribution in a matrix. Jobs are done in parallel.
    # The formal distro which is uploaded to PyPI will be build on
    # ubuntu-latest for python 3.10, which is the recent one.
    # As in dist build no compilation takes place, we run all tests
    # in not accelerated mode.
